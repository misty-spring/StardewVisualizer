## What it does
![A small window with three buttons: Buildings, spring objects, and emotes.](https://github.com/misty-spring/StardewVisualizer/blob/main/img/main_window.png) 

This is a small python script, intended for SDV event-making. 

Since springobjects is huge (936 items), this shows the objects with their according index (to shorten the time it takes to figure this out, ie when adding objects to an event scene).

I made this project for myself, but am releasing it in case it's useful to someone else.

![A small window with a prismatic shard.](https://github.com/misty-spring/StardewVisualizer/blob/main/img/main_springobjs.png) ![A small window with a heart.](https://github.com/misty-spring/StardewVisualizer/blob/main/img/main_emotes.png)

It also shows the index for craftables, and emotes.


## How to use

Just drop `Craftables.png`, `emotes.png` and `springobjects.png` into the `Files` folder.

After that, you can launch `main.py`.
